        The Steyr AUG has been developed since the late 1960s by the Austrian Steyr-Daimler-Puch company in conjunction with the Austrian Army. The AUG stands for Universal Army Rifle. This assault rifle has been adopted in 1977 as the StG.77. Its production commenced in 1978. It replaced the obsolete StG.58 assault rifle, which was a license-built version of the FN FAL. Since its introduction the AUG gained serious popularity. It had been adopted by a number of countries. This weapon is license produced in Australia as the Lithgow F88, commonly known as Austeyr. The AUG can be considered as the most commercially successful bullpup design to date.

        The Steyr AUG is chambered for the standard NATO 5.56x45 mm round. It is a gas operated, selective fire rifle with bullpup layout. This weapon was considered to be revolutionary in many respects when it first appeared. The Steyr AUG made its name for its reliability, good ergonomics and decent accuracy.
     
        The Steyr AUG has a modular design. It was designed as a family of rifles that could be quickly adapted to a variety of roles by simply changing the barrel. There are four basic barrels. The standard rifle barrel is 508 mm (20") long. Later include a compact 350 mm (13.7") barrel , 407 mm (16") carbine barrel, and the 621 mm (24.4") light machine gun barrel. The last mentioned is fitted with integral folding bipod. Barrel replacement takes only a few seconds.
     
        This firearm has a plastic housing. It is worth mentioning that internal design also employs a high level of synthetic and advanced alloy components. When this weapon began to receive widespread public attention in the 1980s, it became the media sensation around the world, but not because of the weight savings and ergonomical improvements that composite materials allowed for. Instead, widespread hysteria broke-out over the supposed ability of this weapon allowing anyone to smuggle them through metal detectors and x-ray machines, because they were "made of plastic". It was either overlooked or ignored that the AUG contained more steel than most submachine guns. It was also somehow forgotten that x-ray machines had no difficulty detecting non-metalic objects.
     
        The AUG assault rifle is fully ambidextrous. There are two symmetrical ejection ports, one of which is always covered. Enlarged triggerguard of this assault rifle allows to fire wearing winter gloves.
        The safety button is located above the pistol grip. The AUG has got no separate fire mode selector. The trigger itself is used to control the mode of fire. Pulling it half the way, will result in a single shot, while the full pull will result in full-auto fire.
     
        The Steyr AUG is fed from box-shaped translucent polymer magazines, that hold 30 rounds. A light machine gun version is fed from extended 42 round magazines. Both of these magazines are interchangeable.
     
        This rifle is fitted with integral telescopic 1.5x magnification sight as a primary sighting equipment. It is designed to be calibrated for 300 m range. At the top of the sight housing there is a back-up iron sight, used in emergency.
     
        Austrian Army rifles had no bayonet lug, however some export versions were fitted with bayonets. Rifles equipped with 407 mm (16") and 508 mm (20") barrels are capable of launching barrel-mounted riffle grenades. A modified AUG is compatible with the US M203PI 40-mm underbarrel grenade launcher. It is a version of the M203A1. The AUG could not mount the original US M203, because the rifle is too short.
