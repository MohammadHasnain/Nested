         <p style="text-align: center"> Nr 1 <a href="./M16.html"> M16</a>(USA)</p>

        <p style="text-align: center">

            The AR-15 was designed by Armalite to meet the US Army requirement for a new assault rifle, chambered for a new intermediate cartridge. <br> It was adopted by the US Army as the M16 and became a standard issue infantry weapon.

   This weapon was designed in the late 1950s. At the time it was a very progressive design. The US Army demanded for a super light weapon. So the M16  has a number of lightweight materials in order to save weight. It uses aluminum in place of steel, fiberglass construction in place of wood. Also it has an ergonomic design. It incorporated many features, never seen before. At the time of its introduction it was called the "Space Rifle".

   The barrel is in one line with the buttstock. This feature significantly reduces the recoil. It operates smoothly during fully automatic fire and is  very easy to control. Consequently it is much more accurate during automatic fire than many other assault rifles. Its superior accuracy gives it a decisive advantage.

   This superior weapon works great in battle, although it does have some faults. Newer models have a Picatinny-type rail and support various optics  and detacheable accessories. It can be also fitted with underbarrel grenade launcher.

   Since its introduction this assault rifle was constantly improved. This influential weapon was built in hundreds of variants. Approximately 8 million  of these assault rifles were manufactures. The M16 and its derivatives are used by more than 70 countries around the world. Today it is still used by the US Army in the form of improved M16A3.

             <p style="text-align: center">Nr 2 <a href="./ak.html">AK-47</a> (Russia)</p>
        

<p style="text-align: center">

    The AK-100 series assault rifles evolved from the AK-74M that is widely used by the Russian Army and many other countries around the world. Technically these assault rifles are similar to the legendary AK-47, but have improved production technologies and are made of new materials.

    One of them is the AK-103. It is chambered for 7.62x39 mm ammunition. It is the original ammunition that is used by the legendary AK-47 assault riffle. It has superior penetration and stopping power comparing with the AK-74M, that is chambered for 5.45x39 mm ammo. Also there is an AK-101, chambered for the standard NATO 5.56x45 mm ammunition.
 
    The AK-103, as well as other rifles of the AK-100 series use the same operation mechanism, developed by Kalashnikov. These weapons made their name for unsurpassed reliability. This assault rifle can withstand any misuse and abuse that soldier can throw at it. It is not very accurate, but will operate in worst conditions possible.
 
    This weapon has a remarkable advantage of simplicity. It is simple in design, is made of common materials and uses readily available machining technology. The parts can be manufactured with less precision. From an engineering standpoint it is a low-tech weapon. Production of these rifles can be established at any factory, that makes steel products. No wonder the Kalashnikov assault rifles are being produced all over the world. Also it is simple to maintain.
 
    Comparing with the M16 it has simplicity and fantastic reliability. However it looses in terms of range and accuracy.
 
    The AK-100 series assault rifles are used by Russian armed forces. These assault rifles have been exported to more than 10 countries. Also some countries produce these weapons locally under license. Derivatives of the legendary AK-47 are in service with more than 100 countries around the world.

<p style="text-align: center">Nr 3 <a href="./G36.html">Heckler & Koch G36 </a>(Germany) </p>

<p style="text-align: center">

    The G36 assault rifle has been designed by Heckler & Koch to replace the G3 assault rifle in service with the Bundeswehr. Since 1995 the G36 is a standard issue infantry rifle with the German armed forces. This weapon became an export success. It has been exported to more than 40 countries around the world.

    The Heckler & Koch G36 is chambered for a standard NATO 5.56x45 mm ammunition. It is a conventional gas operated, selective fire weapon. It uses some proven elements of the previous G3 rifle design. Internally it also bears a lot of similarity with the US Armalite AR-18 automatic rifle. Sophistication was eschewed in favor of reliability. Weapon has a simple layout. During trials a prototype of the HK G36 was rated higher than the Austrian Steyr AUG.
 
    This assault rifle is manufactured using the most modern technologies.
 
    This assault rifle is fed form 30-round box-shaped magazines, made form translucent plastic. Two or three magazines can be clipped together for rapid reloading. This weapon is also compatible with a 100-round dual drum magazines. After some adjustments this rifle can accept any standard NATO 5.56x45 mm magazine.
 
    Sights are built into the carrying handle. A standard German Army rifle has a dual sight system. It consists of one 3.5x magnification scope, for long-range accurate shooting and one 1x magnification red dot sight above it, for close ranges.
 
    This rifle is compatible with the HK AG36 40 mm underbarrel grenade launcher. It can also launch barrel-mounted riffle grenades.
 
    Overall the G36 lacks fancy bells and whistles, but is modern, light, accurate, rugged and reliable weapon. It is not as reliable as the AK-100 series weapons, but definitely makes up for it by its astounding precision. Also the G36 is simple in operation and maintenance.
