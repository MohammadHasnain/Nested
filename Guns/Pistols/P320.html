        The SIG Sauer P320 pistol was introduced in 2014. It is a further development of the SIG Sauer P250. The pistol was aimed at a US Army requirement to replace the M9. The program was known as the XM17 Modular Handgun System. In 2017 the SIG Sauer won against 8 other competitors to provide new pistols for the US Air Force and US Army. Within the next 10 years the M9 pistols will be gradually replaced by the P320, which will enter service as the M17. It is expected that a contract for roughly 280 000 full-size pistols will be awarded for the US Army, more than 200 000 for the Air Force, Navy and Marines, plus perhaps as many as 10 000 compact pistols. It is going to be the largest pistol contract since 1985, when the US Army adopted the Beretta 92FS as the M9. The SIG Sauer P320 pistol is also being proposed for customers from other countries, law enforcement forces and commercial market. Thai law enforcement forces ordered a large number of these pistols. Commercial version of the P320, that has some differences from the military model.

        It is a modular multi-caliber pistol. Manufacturer offers conversion kits for this pistol. Caliber conversions are performed simply changing barrels, slides, frames and magazines. All models use the same trigger group. So the same trigger group is easily moved between different sized frames to make full-size, compact or even subcompact pistol. The P320 can be quickly converted to various calibers, including 9x19 mm, .40 S&W, .375 SIG, .380 ACP and .45 ACP.
     
        The P320 is a self-cocking striker-fired pistol with a double-action only trigger. It is a short recoil operated weapon, which fires with the locked breech. It uses the typical SIG Sauer cam-operated barrel.
     
        The slide is made of stainless steel. Frame is made of polymer. This pistol has got no grip backstraps. However developers claim that it will fit for any hand size. Slide hold and release buttons are also ambidextrous.
     
        The P320 is available with a Glock-style trigger safety. A manual frame-mounted thumb safety is available as an option.
     
        A 9x19 mm full-size version of the P320 uses 17-round capacity double-stack magazines. Magazine capacity differs depending on the chambering of the pistol. Versions chambered in .40 S&W and .375 SIG use 14-round capacity magazines. Version chambered in .45 ACP uses 10-round magazines. Magazine release button is reversible.
     
        The SIG Sauer P320 comes with a standard Picatinny-type pistol rail. It accepts all standard tactical accessories, such as flashlights and laser pointers.
     
        This pistol has got 3-dot iron sights. Both front and rear sights can be adjusted for windage and elevation.
     
        This weapon can be field stripped without using any tools.
