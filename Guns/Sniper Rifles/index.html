<p style="text-align: center">
    The Barrett M82 is a semi-automatic anti-material rifle, designed and developed by Barrett Firearms Manufacturing company. Development of this powerful anti-material rifle began in the early 1980s. Working versions were ready by 1982, hence the designation M82. It is worth noting that the M82 is a company designation, rather than a US military designation. The company successfully sold 100 rifles to Swedish Armed Forces in 1989. In 1990-1991 US Marine Corps obtained around 125 of these rifles. Soon followed orders from the US Army and Air Force. Today this anti-material rifle is in service with nearly 60 countries and used by military and law enforcement forces. In a number of countries this anti-material rifle is used as a long-range anti-personnel sniper weapon.

    This rifle was designed to destroy sensitive enemy equipment, like parked aircraft, radar units, trucks and various other important assets at long range. It is used for remote destruction of explosive ordnance. Even though it was originally designed as an anti-material rifle, the Barrett M82 is also used as a long-range sniper rifle. It can neutralize enemy snipers at standoff range. This rifle can be also used to hit enemy soldiers, that are hiding behind cover and walls, as its powerful ammunition can penetrate through bricks and concrete. However the Barrett M82 is primarily used as anti-material weapon.
 
    The Barrett M82 is chambered for powerful 12.7x99 mm (.50 BMG) ammunition. This ammunition was originally developed for and used in Browning M2 heavy machine gun. Sometimes the Barrett M82 is referred as "Light Fifty" for its cartridge.
 
    This weapon has a unique recoil reduction mechanism. The muzzle brake is said to absorb 70% of the recoil. It reduces the forces acting on internal mechanisms and the shooter.
 
    This weapon is fed from 10-round detachable magazines.
 
    The Barrett M82 was often fitted with 10x magnification scope. This weapon can be also used with night vision scopes. There is a flip-up iron sight for emergency use in case of scope damage. Modern variants have a Picatinny-type scope rail on top of the receiver.
 
    The original Barrett M82 has a built-in carrying handle, while the modern versions come with quick-detachable one. This rifle also has a detachable bipod. This weapon can be fitted with carry sling. However due to its size the Barrett M82 is usually carried in special case. There are all kinds of cases and range bags available for various weapons. Such as the best ar 15 soft case for your rifle.
 
    The unit cost of the M82 rifle is around $8 900.

<p style="text-align: center"> Nr 2 <a href="./Steyrssg69.html"> Steyr SSG 69</a>(Austria)</p>


<p style="text-align: center">
    The Steyr Scharfschutzengewehr 69, or SSG 69 is an Austrian sniper rifle. Externally it resembles a hunting rifle, however it was specially designed as a weapon for military and law enforcement forces. Since the mid 1960s the Austrian Army was looking for an advanced sniper rifle to equip its own snipers. In 1969 the rifle designed by Steyr was adopted by the Austrian Army as a standard sniper weapon, hence its designation. After the break up of the Steyr-Daimler-Puch company, its firearm manufacturing division became independent. Since 1987-1989 this sniper rifle was produced by Steyr Mannlicher. Eventually this weapon made its name for impressive accuracy and was adopted by a number of countries from all over the world, where it is used by military or law enforcement forces. Currently the SSG 69 is one of the most popular sniper rifles in the world. Export operators include Argentina, Chile, Greece, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Jordan, Netherlands, Pakistan, Peru, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. This sniper rifle is even used by a US BORTAC border patrol unit. This weapon saw action during numerous wars and military conflicts. The SSG 69 was produced without changes for more than 40 years. Its production ceased only in 2015. It was succeeded by a modern SSG 08 sniper rifle.

    The Steyr SSG 69 is a bolt-action weapon. It is chambered for a standard NATO 7.62x51 mm (.308 Winchester) cartridge. At the time of its introduction in the late 1960s this weapon was different than most contemporary sniper rifles. Design of the SSG 69 was rather unique. Some of its features were cutting-edge back in the late 1960s. It used synthetic materials for light weight and cold hammer-forged barrels for durability. Also it had detachable magazine of unusual design.
 
    The SSG 69 sniper rifle is relatively compact. It comes with a 650 mm (25.6") barrel. Furthermore it a very light rifle. Modern equivalents with similar performance weigh nearly twice as much. Also the Austrian SSG 69 proved to be a reliable and durable design.
 
    This sniper rifle uses an unusual detachable rotary magazine, that holds 5 rounds. The  magazine is transparent, so it is easy to see how many rounds are loaded. The magazine is released by squeezing two release buttons on either side of the magazine. A larger 10-round box magazine was available as an accessory. It protrudes down bellow the rifle.
 
    The stock is made of fiberglass. Back in the late 1960s it was a novelty, as most other rifles had wooden stocks. Contemporary weapons, that were adopted during similar time frame, including the US Army's M21, USMC's M40 and German Mauser SP66, all had wooden stocks. So even though the SSG 69 may not have been the first rifle with a synthetic stock, but it was certainly pioneering that Steyr was using this feature as standard. The buttstock is hollow to keep the weight down. Also the buttstock has a spacer system, that allows for adjusting the length of pull by adding or removing spacers.
 
    This weapon is popular due to its accuracy. The Steyr SSG 69 demonstrated sub 0.5 MOA accuracy during several international competitions. Back in the late 1960s just a few custom rifles were sub-MOA accurate. The SSG 69 is normally used with a scope. Originally Austrian Army rifles were paired with Kahles ZF69 6x magnification scopes. With this scope the rifle was effective out to 600 meters. Later a Kahles ZF84 10x magnification scope was adopted. It extend effective range of the rifle out to 800 meters. There are auxiliary iron sights for emergency use.
 
    There is a standard accessory rail on the bottom of the forearm. It is used for mounting sling studs and bipod. However despite its impressive accuracy the SSG 69 can not match ergonomics of modern rifles. It lacks a proper pistol grip, fully adjustable stock or Picatinny-type rails. Furthermore there is no means of mounting any sort of scope rail. Despite the fact that the SSG 69 is out-dated, it remains a very competitive design. In terms of performance it meets modern standards.
 
    There are several variants of this sniper rifle, however most of them have only cosmetic differences. The only anomaly is the SSG PIV silenced sniper rifle, that was designed to be used in conjunction with a sound suppressor.

<p style="text-align: center"> Nr 3 <a href="./Magnum.html">Accuracy International Arctic Warfare Magnum</a>(United States)</p>


<p style="text-align: center">
    The Arctic Warfare Magnum (AWM) is a British sniper rifle. It is a product of Accuracy International company. It is a more powerful version of the Arctic Warfare sniper rifle, designed to use larger and more powerful Magnum-type cartridges. The word "Magnum" in the designation denotes the Magnum chambering. There are two main versions of this weapon, chambered for .300 Winchester Magnum and .338 Lapua Magnum ammunition. This weapon was adopted in 1996. Version chambered for .300 Winchester Magnum is in service with the Czech Republic, Germany (locally designated as the G22), and some other countries. Another version, chambered for .338 Lapua Magnum was adopted by at least 14 countries, including Ireland, Israel, Italy, Malaysia, Netherlands, Norway, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. This sniper rifle saw action during wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

    It is a bolt-action sniper rifle. Generally the Arctic Warfare Magnum is similar to the original Arctic Warfare sniper rifle, but has a longer bolt to accommodate the larger and more powerful Magnum-type ammunition. This weapon has a stainless steel 660 mm (26") barrel. It is fed from detachable 5-round capacity magazines.
 
    The .300 Winchester Magnum (7.62x67 mm) cartridge was originally designed as a hunting ammunition. It has a flatter trajectory and significantly increased muzzle velocity, wind resistance and supersonic range than the standard NATO .308 Winchester (7.62x51 mm) cartridge. As a result it has significantly longer effective range. The Arctic Warfare Magnum rifle chambered for this ammunition has an effective range of 1 100 meters.
 
    Another version, chambered for the .338 Lapua Magnum, is much more powerful. This cartridge was specially designed for military snipers as long-range sniping ammunition. Its effective range is comparable with that of .50 BMG (12.7x99 mm) cartridge, though the .338 Lapua Magnum develops significantly less kinetic energy and penetration. It outperforms the .300 Winchester Magnum version. The Arctic Warfare Magnum rifle, chambered for this ammunition, has an effective range of 1 500 - 1 700 meters.  In some cases the .338 Lapua Magnum round can reportedly penetrate armored glass. This weapon is one of the best sniper rifles in the world. In fact in 2009 the second longest sniper kill in history was made with the L115A3 rifle (British version of the Arctic Warfare Magnum) in Afghanistan. A British Army sniper Craig Harrison killed two Taliban fighters at a range of 2 475 meters. At the time it was the longest sniper kill ever made.
 
    This sniper rifle has a solid buttstock. Though there is a version with a folding buttstock stock. It is designated as the Arctic Warfare Magnum-Folding, (or AWM-F). This weapon is more comfortable to carry in a backpack.

<p style="text-align: center"> Nr 4 <a href="./M95.html"> Barrett M95 </a> (United States)</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
    The Barrett M95 is a manual bolt-action anti-material and sniper rifle, designed by Barrett Firearms Manufacturing company. It is an improved production version of the Barrett M90. The major difference is that the pistol grip with the trigger have been moved slightly forward for better magazine clearance. Thus the new weapon is more comfortable to use. In 1995 the Barrett M95 replaced in production the original Barrett M90. The M95 is a company designation, rather than a US military designation. The number in the designation denotes the year 1995, when a working version of the rifle was ready. This weapon is proposed as a lighter, more compact and manually-operated alternative to the semi-automatic Barrett M82. It is intended for elite military and law enforcement units. In 1999 this weapon was selected for a US Army trials to become the new XM107. A small number of these rifles were purchased for trials and evaluation, however eventually the Barrett M82 was selected. Still though the Barrett M95 was adopted by a number of countries from all around the world. The Barrett company announces that this sniper rifle is used by 15 countries. This weapon is used by Argentina, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Georgia, Italy, Jordan, Malaysia, Philippines, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, and some other countries. However the Barrett M95 could never match the popularity of the original Barrett M82, that is in service with nearly 60 countries. As of 2017 the Barrett M95 is still being offered.

    Essentially the Barrett M95 can be seen as a manually-operated version of the Barrett M82 with a bullpup layout. The bullpup layout, as well as more simple bolt-action operation, allowed to reduce overall length and size of the weapon. However it maintains barrel length and performance of the M82.
 
    The M95 is chambered for a powerful 12.7x99 mm (.50 BMG) cartridge. This weapon comes with a 736 mm (29") barrel.
 
    This sniper rifle has a manual thumb-lever safety. The Barrett M95 can be easily field stripped for cleaning and maintenance. The weapon can be disassembled or assembled for cleaning within 60 seconds, without using any tools.
 
    This rifle is used to destroy sensitive enemy equipment, like parked aircraft, radar units, trucks and various other important assets at long range. It is also used for remote destruction of explosive ordnance. Even though the Barrett M95 was originally designed as an anti-material rifle, it is often used as a long-range anti-personnel sniper weapon. It can neutralize enemy snipers at standoff ranges. Furthermore this rifle can be also used to hit enemy soldiers, that are hiding behind cover and walls, as its powerful ammunition can penetrate through bricks and concrete.
 
    This weapon has a unique recoil reduction mechanism. Its highly-effective muzzle brake is said to absorb 70% of the recoil. The muzzle brake reduces the forces acting on internal mechanisms and the shooter. There is also a highly absorbent recoil pad.
 
    The Barrett M95 is fed from detachable 5-round capacity magazine.
